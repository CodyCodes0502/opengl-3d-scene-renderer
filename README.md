# CS-330
Project from CS-330 - Comp Graphics and Visualization

    How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  This project really helped me to think of how different shapes interact within a 3D space to make up the scenes that we see in everyday life. This allowed me to better implement the 3D shapes in OpenGl, and manipulate those into creating a 3D scene.
  
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
  For this I started from the ground up. By first creating the plane that the shapes would be sitting on, I could then start making the shapes that were sitting on the ground, then the shapes that we sitting on those. This allowed me to base the scale off the first object I created, which in this case was the cat scratching post. Once that was in place it was very easy to implement the other shapes in the scene.
  
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  Doing things one step at a time from the most basic "ground level" then working your way up is exactly how I design and code for other applications, in both school and personal projects. I think this 'one step at a time' approach is key to consistant and efficiant work.
  
    How do I approach developing programs?  
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  For this project I am not sure I would say I used new development stratigies, moreso just refined stratigies that I had used on past projects. They often say that development and coding is an itterative process, well I am finding that once you have a development strategy that works for you, refining it is also an itterative process where every project you work on you get that much better at your chosen way of developing.
  
        How did iteration factor into your development?
  Itteration was a huge factor in my devlopment of my scene. Every time I worked on the project I would work on one specific part, whether it be the first object, the textures, the lighting, and I would work on that piece of the scene until it was done to a satisfactory degree, then I would work on the next part. This often led to needing to go back and make adjustments to previous pieces to make sure they were just right, but that is part of the itterative process. 
  
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
  This project really helped reinforce going back over my previous work to ensure I had everything correct. After first creating the object in the scene, I then made controls to move about the scene and change the angle at which you were looking at the object. After being able to change the angle, it turned out that the shapes of my object were not attached to each other at all, they just appeared that way when viewing from one particular angle. After learning this I had to go back and check all my shapes were positioned correctly. 
  
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  This class has given me the new skill of creating a visually appealing 3d scene in OpenGl, which is going to be an important skill to have when working with OpenGl in future classes, but my carreer as well.
